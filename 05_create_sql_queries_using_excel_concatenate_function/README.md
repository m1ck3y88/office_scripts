# Create SQL Queries Using Excel Concatenate Function

## Note:

This directory contains a copy of the Excel file that was created with the script
from the previous chapter (04 Read SQL Database Create CSV and Convert to Excel)
except I added a Concatenate function to the last column (column 'K') that creates 
an SQL query from the dummy database that was also used in the previous chapter. 
Keep in mind that the SQL query I created is just an example and doesn't necessarily 
represent a specific formula that has to be followed <strong><em>exactly</em></strong>. 
The demonstration is to teach the proper syntax for creating SQL queries with cells 
in your Excel spreadsheet using Excel's Concatenate function. To see the function's 
syntax, just click on the first row under the column titled 'concatenate_sql_query'.

If you have questions or need further explanation, feel free to email me with business

Thank you,
